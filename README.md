# freeCodeCamp-learning-log

This repository contains my solutions and practice exercises completed as part of the **freeCodeCamp** curriculum.

The purpose of this repository is to systematically build strong foundations in **web development**, with a focus on **JavaScript**, **frontend technologies**, and further progression towards **React and mobile development (React Native)**.

---

## Coverage

The repository follows the official freeCodeCamp learning paths:

- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Certification
- Frontend Development Libraries (React, Redux – upcoming)

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized according to freeCodeCamp sections and topics:

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Git & GitHub

---

## Learning Approach

- Exercises are grouped by topic to reflect the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
- Not every small challenge is stored as a separate file; related exercises may be grouped logically.
- Code quality and structure improve progressively as my skills develop (hope so at least).
- Notes include personal observations, common pitfalls, and key takeaways.

---

## Learning Platform

All exercises are based on the official freeCodeCamp curriculum:  
https://www.freecodecamp.org

---

## Future Plans

- React projects
- React Native / Mobile development
- API-based applications
- Portfolio-ready projects in separate repositories
